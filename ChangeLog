	* src/reboot.c: New file containing code to deal with reboot
	notifications.
	* src/reboot.h: Header for new code.
	* src/Makefile.am (update_notifier_SOURCES): Add new source files
	to the binary.
	
	* src/update-notifier.c (tray_icons_init): Initialise the reboot
	tray icon as well.
	(fam_init): Initialise watch for the reboot-required file.
	(fam_check): If the reboot-required file gets touched or remove,
	run the reboot_check function.
	* src/update-notifier.h (struct _UpgradeNotifier): Add pointer to
	reboot tray applet and request context for watching the file we'll
	use to do this.

	* data/notify-reboot-required: instead of copying a hook into the
	directory, touch /var/run/reboot-required which is sufficient for
	that message.  Obviously anything wanting to give more detail can
	still use the hooks.

	* data/Makefile.am (templates_DATA): Drop this now there's no hook.

	* pixmaps/reboot.png: Copied pixmap from the Ubuntu logout dialog.
